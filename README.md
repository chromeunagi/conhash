# conhash
A minimalistic load balancing package written for Go.

# how to plug this baby in
use md5 or some battle-tested hashing algorithm. if you're a cool
kid that wants to implement your own, don't complain that my
shit isn't working.

dont forget to use run

# initialization
nodes + copies. talk about parameters.
dont forget to use run

# using it
NodeDown, NodeUp, Route

# routing
basic algorithm

# health checks
ping nodes, if possible. figure this shit out. this would be
the cherry on top.

# runtime 
asymptotics. number of operations per thing.

# memory footprint
how many nodes, etc. some sort of constants plus some tasteful
asymptotics
